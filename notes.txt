Let's build a simulation of the good/bad categorizaton

- create an idle long running process
- make the process consume cpu like crazy (bad)
- make the process stop consuming cpu (good)

- This way we will be able to spin up a desired number of apps and make them bahave the way we want
- Have a script that knows all processes pids and that can move them between the two categories.
